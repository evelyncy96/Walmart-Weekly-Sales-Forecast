# Walmart-Weekly-Sales-Forecast
We are data scientists who are passionate about retail industry. We also notice that time series is a relatively important topic in sales prediction. Hence, we decided to take sales data from Walmart (2010~2013) as an example and created a time series model to predict 45 different Walmart storesâ€™ sales. We ended up using same parameters and machine learning methods to develop Forecast Models for each store. Thus, we have total 45 Forecasting Models for these 45 stores.

The entire visualization is done using Tableau interactive dashboard. You can access them via the two links below.

Since the overall files are too big to be put on the repository, we stored all the data on google drive. If you are interested in further detail, feel free to access the belowing link for raw data, R files, and Python files.
