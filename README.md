# Walmart-Weekly-Sales-Forecast
We are data scientists who are passionate about retail industry. We also notice that time series is a relatively important topic in sales prediction. Hence, we decided to take sales data from Walmart (2010~2013) as an example and created a time series model to predict 45 different Walmart storesâ€™ sales. We ended up using same parameters and machine learning methods to develop Forecast Models for each store. Thus, we have total 45 Forecasting Models for these 45 stores.
